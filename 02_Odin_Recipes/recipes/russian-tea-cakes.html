  <h2>Description</h2>
  These Russian tea cakes are rolled in powdered sugar for a sweet finish and a snowball-like appearance. My grandmother
  "Bubba" brought this Russian tea cake recipe with her when she came from Lithuania, and now my family has made it for
  many generations. I pass it on in the true spirit of the holiday season!
  <p> Russian tea cakes (a.k.a. snowball cookies) are incredibly easy to make with pantry staples. The
    melt-in-your-mouth dessert is a simple way to satisfy your sweet tooth during the holiday season. </p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Butter:</b> These easy Russian tea cakes start with a stick of unsalted butter.</li>
    <li><b>Vanilla:</b> A teaspoon of vanilla extract enhances the flavor and adds complexity.</li>
    <li><b>Flour:</b> All-purpose flour adds structure and holds the dough together.</li>
    <li><b>Sugar:</b> You'll need powdered sugar for the dough and to roll the tea cakes.</li>
    <li><b>Walnuts:</b> Finely chopped walnuts add nutty flavor and welcome crunch. </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li> Gather all ingredients.</li>
    <li> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
    <li> Cream butter and vanilla together in a medium bowl with an electric mixer until smooth, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
    <li> Whisk flour and 6 tablespoons powdered sugar together in separate bowl. Add to the butter mixture and stir until just blended. Add walnuts and mix until incorporated; mixture may be crumbly.</li>
    <li> Take small scoops of dough and roll between your hands into 1-inch balls. Place balls 2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheets.</li>
    <li> Bake in the preheated oven until edges are just turning golden, about 12 minutes.</li>
    <li> Remove from the oven and transfer to a wire rack to cool for 15 minutes.</li>
    <li> Place remaining 1/3 cup powdered sugar in a small bowl. Roll cooled cookies in the powdered sugar once or twice.</li>
    <li>Enjoy!</li>
